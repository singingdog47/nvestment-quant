## Interpretation guardrails

- Japanese equities use 1306.T as the TOPIX-linked benchmark proxy; explicit US markets use SPY.
- Unknown markets are left without benchmark attribution rather than guessed.
- Do not change factor weights automatically from small samples.
- Separate model error from data-quality failure and regime misclassification.
- Promote a model change only after an explicit human review and version bump.
- Human brokerage actions remain private and are joined by decision_id outside the public repository.
